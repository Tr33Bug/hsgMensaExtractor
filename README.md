# HSG Mensa Extractor

This repository contains the `mensaExtractor.py` script, which is designed to extract and process menu information from the HSG and OST Mensa provided by *Migros Ostschweiz*. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This repository is unofficial and not affiliated with either HSG or OST. It is a small experimental project created for personal or educational purposes.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The results of this project are generated by parsing a PDF. Due to the nature of the parser, there may be occasional parsing errors. Additionally, if the format of the PDF is significantly altered, the parsing process may encounter issues or fail.

Please keep this in mind when using the project.
